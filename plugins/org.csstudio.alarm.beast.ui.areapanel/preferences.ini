# Alarm Area Panel Settings

# Select which level of the alarm tree hierarchy
# is displayed by the panel
# 0 - The alarm tree root (bad idea)
# 1 - 'Area' items, 1st level of alarm tree (normal case)
# 2 - 'System' items, 2nd level of alarm tree, one below 'areas' (possible)
# 3 - 'Subsystem' items, 3rd level (unlikely)
# higher - why?
hierarchy_level=1

# Number of columns to show in panel
columns=2
