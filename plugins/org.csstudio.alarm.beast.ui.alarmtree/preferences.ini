# Default settings
# Final product can override in its plugin_preferences.ini

# Allow selecting multiple entries in the alarm tree?
# I.e. using 'Ctrl' or 'Shift' when clicking on items?
#
# Because of Bug 259141:
# Tree.getSelection() is extremely slow with SWT.VIRTUAL and SWT.MULTI
# https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=259141
# it is currently suggested to not allow multi-selection.
# When enabling multi-selection, a workaround is used that is
# still better than the original bug, but using a display without
# support for multiple selections is fastest.
